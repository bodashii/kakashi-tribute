    <h2>How did we come across Kakashi?</h2>
    <article>
        <p>On the way home from a shopping trip, my girlfriend spotted something on the side of the road.
            Just for some scene development, its January or February in Texas. It was one of those it can freeze here too winters...
            We found this white fur ball of a rabbit holding down the fort at a pole that use to be a street sign.
            This was just outside of the city. Fortunately it was less than a block to the house. We darted home     and
            outfitted ourselves with anything useful.
        </p>
        <p>We came out with a kennel, butterfly net, and some gloves.  He was a quick rabbit but I'd soon learn that was
            a small extent of his speed. After about twenty minutes and discovering he was blind in his right eye we caught him!
            We accepted from the start that we would more than likely be the proud parents of Kakashi the buninja.
